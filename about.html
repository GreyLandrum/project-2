          <h2>Humble Beginnings</h2>
          <p class="fs-5">
            Sean's Breakfast Shack - created by Sean [last name] from Ripley,
            Tennessee - has had a variety of ups and downs over the course of
            its unfortunately long time in business. While many people would
            consider it a great place to stop by and get some quick breakfast
            food, it's actually much more than that. It all began during Sean's
            rocky upbringing. As a child, his mother would only feed him
            pancakes. One pancake for breakfast, one for lunch, and one for
            dinner. This might make it sound like Sean was living the dream, but
            the pancakes weren't actually very good. He didn't even get to use
            syrup with them so like what's the point ya know? However, none of
            this mattered to Sean. Despite the shocking lack of any vitamins and
            minerals in his bloodstream, he grew to love pancakes by a sort of
            pancake-themed stockholm syndrome. Once he turned 16 he was allowed
            to eat other breakfast foods such as sausage, bacon, and hashbrowns.
            With this new knowledge of the full spectrom of breakfast food, Sean
            was absolutely unstoppale. He opened Sean's Breakfast Shack in 2011
            following his divorce from his ex-wife Connie. (we hate Connie.
            Screw you Connie) Since then, Sean's breakfast shack has grown into
            a multi-dollar company turning over nearly $100 in revenue every
            year! Unfortunately, disaster struck late one October night while
            Sean was trying to make his signature dish "deep fried ice." Oil
            from the resulting steam explosion launched hot oil into the open
            fire Sean kept burning in the dining room to keep the place warm
            during winter. (Sean neglected to pay the heating bill)

            The deadly grease fire spread from the dining room back into the
            kitchen setting the entire restaurant ablaze. All staff present at
            the time died except for Sean himself and the raccoon named "Rocco"
            That he kept in the deep freeze to eat bugs that may cause an
            infestation. Sean is now running the business out of his home.
            Patrons can contact his number, then go in person to pick up the
            food which Sean leaves on his porch for them to pick up. Basically
            it's a trap house for breakfast food.
